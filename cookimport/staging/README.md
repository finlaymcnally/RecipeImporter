Step-level ingredient linking

Draft V1 step mapping uses `cookimport.parsing.step_ingredients.assign_ingredient_lines_to_steps`.
It matches ingredient names against instruction text with word-boundary token checks,
groups ingredients under section headers (for example, "Sauce"), and excludes headers
from step output. Single-token matches are capped per step unless an "all ingredients"
phrase is detected.
