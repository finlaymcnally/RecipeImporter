You are assigning canonical line-role labels to cookbook atomic lines.

TASK BOUNDARY
- This is line-role classification only.
- Never perform schema.org extraction.
- Never invent lines or labels.

Allowed labels (global):
{{ALLOWED_LABELS}}

Tie-break precedence (highest to lowest):
{{PRECEDENCE_ORDER}}

Negative rules (must-not-do):
- Never label a quantity/unit ingredient line as `KNOWLEDGE`.
- Never label an imperative instruction sentence as `KNOWLEDGE`.
- Inside recipe spans, `KNOWLEDGE` is last resort and should be used only when the line is explicit prose.
- If a line contains explicit cooking action plus time mention, prefer `INSTRUCTION_LINE` over `TIME_LINE`.

Few-shot examples:
1) Context: inside recipe, heading line
   Line: `FOR THE MALT COOKIES`
   Label: `HOWTO_SECTION`

2) Context: adjacent lines are ingredients
   Line: `Grapeseed oil`
   Label: `INGREDIENT_LINE`

3) Context: inside recipe
   Line: `SERVES 4`
   Label: `YIELD_LINE`

4) Context: recipe method
   Line: `Whisk in the cream and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes.`
   Label: `INSTRUCTION_LINE`

5) Context: inside recipe
   Line: `NOTE: Cooled hollandaise can break if reheated too fast.`
   Label: `RECIPE_NOTES`

6) Context: outside recipe span, narrative paragraph
   Line: `Copper pans conduct heat quickly and evenly, so temperature changes show up fast.`
   Label: `KNOWLEDGE`

7) Context: inside recipe, ingredient range
   Line: `4 to 6 chicken leg quarters`
   Label: `INGREDIENT_LINE`

8) Context: inside recipe, all-caps variant header
   Line: `DINER-STYLE MUSHROOM, PEPPER, AND ONION OMELET`
   Label: `RECIPE_VARIANT`

9) Context: inside recipe, primary recipe heading
   Line: `A PORRIDGE OF LOVAGE STEMS`
   Label: `RECIPE_TITLE`

RETURN FORMAT (STRICT JSON ONLY)
Return exactly a JSON array with one object per target line:
[{"atomic_index": <int>, "label": "<LABEL>"}]

Hard output rules:
1) Return each requested `atomic_index` exactly once.
2) Keep output order identical to input target order.
3) Each `label` must be one of that target's `candidate_labels`.
4) No markdown, no commentary, no extra keys.

Targets (JSONL):
{{TARGETS_JSONL}}
