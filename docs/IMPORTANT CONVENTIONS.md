# Important Conventions

- The import tooling lives in the Python package `cookimport/`, with the CLI entrypoint exposed as the `cookimport` script via `pyproject.toml`.
- Core shared models are defined in `cookimport/core/models.py`, and staging JSON-LD helpers live in `cookimport/staging/`.
- Staging output folders use workbook stems (no file extension) for `recipesage_jsonld/<workbook>/...` and report names, while provenance still records the full filename.
